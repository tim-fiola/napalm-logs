# This error tag corresponds to syslog messages notifying that the configured
# bgp neighbor has changed state
messages:
  # 'error' should be unique and vendor agnostic. Currently we are using the JUNOS syslog message name as the canonical name.
  # This may change if we are able to find a more well defined naming system.
